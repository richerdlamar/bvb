GTA V cheat
<!-- The open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles,[41] and its design and in-game render constituted much of the game's early work.[42] Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage.[38] Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos's road networks.[43][44] To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles's demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city.[36] The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.[45]

A fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series' core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one.[42] The idea was first raised during Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible.[34] Having developed two Grand Theft Auto IV episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009, the team wanted to base Grand Theft Auto V around three simultaneously controlled protagonists.[11] The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3), and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics.[19][46] They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system[47] and reworked the driving mechanics to correct Grand Theft Auto IV's awkward vehicle controls.[48]
